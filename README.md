# Online-Job-Portal

## Overview
This project aims to build an **Online Job Portal** that simplifies the process of connecting job seekers with employers. By integrating a user-friendly interface, advanced job-matching algorithms, and secure data management, the platform streamlines both the job search and hiring processes.

## Database Design
- **Entities**: 
  - Applicants (personal info, skills, education, experience)
  - Employers (company info, job postings)
  - Jobs (position details, qualifications, pay, deadline)
  - Applications (applicant ID, job ID, status)
  - Skills, Education, Experience as related entities
- **Relationships**:
  - One-to-Many between Applicants and Applications, Employers and Jobs
  - Many-to-Many between Applicants and Skills
  - One-to-Many for Applicants with multiple Education and Experience entries

## System Architecture
The system architecture includes a web-based application for users (both job seekers and employers), a relational database management system to handle the data, and secure authentication systems. The backend integrates with the frontend to manage dynamic job searches, user profiles, and applications.

## Future Enhancements
- **Machine Learning-Powered Job Matching**: Improve job recommendations through AI-based algorithms.
- **Employer Tools**: Advanced features like automated interview scheduling and skill assessment tests.
- **Skill Development**: Integrate learning resources for job seekers to improve their competitiveness.

## Conclusion
This **Online Job Portal** is a comprehensive platform designed to address gaps in the current job market. It not only simplifies the process for job seekers but also empowers employers with data-driven hiring tools, making the recruitment process more efficient and effective.
